# Identity Operators

`is` & `is not` compares the addresses (memory locations) of two variables.

<br> Addresses are same for smaller size strings and numbers
and are NOT for larger sizes.
# Member Ship Operators
`in` and `not in` can be used to check if a sequence is in an object or not

Data inside a variable in stored as objects, and when two variables have same data (small data) ,they will be connected to the same object

Unary operators don't exist in python (why?)
