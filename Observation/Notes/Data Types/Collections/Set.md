# Set
can be created as `s_1 = set()` <br>
**sets are not ordered hence cannot be indexed**
<br> sets can be assigned after creating by ` s_1 = {23,21,25,76}`. <br>
sets cannot be `id()`ed
<br> Are sets mutable? <br> [^1]
Sets are non-redundant, a.k.a will remove repeated elements.<br>
Sets are not hashable, but only hashable objects can be elements of sets. Hence lists cannot be a part of sets, but tuples can be.

# Footnotes
[^1]: Mutable means the address is retained when the object is changed.
