# Tuple
Tuple can be created like `tup_1 = ()`
<br>Tuple's are NOT mutable<br>
These are compatible with heterogenous type of data and this tuple is close to a **list ()** 
<br> Tuple is hashable
<br>Again these are ordered and indexed <br>
`a = (2)` is **int** but `a = (2,)` is a **tuple** <br>
More such can be stored like `a = (2,2.3,'a', "vinyl")`
