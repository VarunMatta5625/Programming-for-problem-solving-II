## What is Federated Learning (FL)?
---
**Federated Learning** (FL) is a machine learning setting where multiple entities, referred to as clients, collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server or service provider. 
The clients' raw data is stored locally and not exchanged or transferred. Instead, focused updates intended for immediate aggregation are used to achieve the learning objective. This approach embodies the principles of focused data collection and minimization and mitigates many of the systemic privacy risks and costs that result from traditional, centralized machine learning approaches.

Here are some key characteristics of Federated Learning:
- __Decentralized Data__: The training data remains on the client devices.
- __Privacy__: FL aims to protect user privacy by keeping data local and only sharing model updates with the server. The raw data is never exposed to the server or other clients.
- __Communication Efficiency__: Because client devices often have slow or unstable internet connections, minimizing communication costs is a key challenge in FL.
- __Heterogeneous Data__: Data on client devices is typically non-IID (non-identically and independently distributed). This means that each client's data is drawn from a different distribution. This can be due to differences in user behavior or other factors.
- __Large Number of Clients__: FL typically involves a large number of clients, such as mobile phones or IoT devices.
- __Client Unreliability__: Client devices can be unreliable due to network issues, battery limitations, or other factors.

There are different types of federated learning, including:
- __Cross-device FL__: This involves a very large number of mobile or IoT devices as clients. Data is typically partitioned by example (horizontal).
- __Cross-silo FL__: This involves a smaller number of clients, often organizations or geo-distributed datacenters. Data can be partitioned by example or by feature (vertical).
- __Federated Transfer Learning (FTL)__: This type of FL is used in scenarios where the data parties only share a partial overlap in the user or feature space.

__In a typical federated learning process:__
1) A server orchestrates the training process.
2)	The server selects a subset of clients for training.
3)	The server sends the current model to the selected clients.
4)	The clients update the model based on their local data.
5)	The clients send their model updates to the server.
6)	The server aggregates the updates to create a new global model.
7)	The process repeats until training is stopped.

The key goal of FL is to train a high-quality centralized model without having to centralize the training data. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive data, where it is important to respect user privacy


## How does FL differ from traditional machine learning and Why is FL important for privacy-preserving AI?
Federated learning (FL) differs from traditional machine learning in several key aspects, primarily in how data is handled and the training process is structured. Traditional machine learning typically relies on centralized datasets, where all training data is collected and stored in one location, such as a data center, and then used to train a model. In contrast, FL keeps the training data decentralized, residing on individual client devices, such as mobile phones or within organizations.
Here are some of the key differences:
•	Data Location: Traditional ML centralizes data; FL keeps it on client devices.
•	Data Access: Traditional ML has direct access to the entire dataset; FL does not.
•	Training Process: Traditional ML typically trains a model using data from a single source. FL trains a model collaboratively across many devices.
•	Communication: Traditional ML may not have significant communication constraints. FL needs to be highly communication-efficient due to limited bandwidth and unstable networks.
•	Data Distribution: Traditional ML often assumes data is IID (identically and independently distributed). FL deals with non-IID data, where the distribution varies across clients.
•	Privacy: Traditional ML does not inherently ensure privacy; FL is designed to minimize privacy risks by keeping data local.
FL is important for privacy-preserving AI because it decouples the ability to do machine learning from the need to store data in the cloud or other centralized locations. This is achieved by training models on local devices and only sharing model updates, such as gradient updates, with a central server. These updates are more focused on the learning task and contain less information than the raw data. In other words, federated learning focuses on the principle of data minimization and only shares what is needed to train the model.
Here’s why FL is important for privacy:
•	Data Minimization: By only sharing model updates, FL minimizes the exposure of sensitive raw data, which is kept locally on users' devices.
•	Reduced Attack Surface: Keeping data decentralized reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there is no single location to target.
•	Privacy by Design: FL is designed with privacy in mind from the outset, unlike traditional ML where privacy often has to be added as an afterthought.
•	Legal Compliance: FL can help organizations comply with user privacy laws such as the GDPR, by not requiring the transfer of raw user data.
•	User Control: FL puts the users more in control of their own data because their data is not transferred to a central server.
While FL provides a significant improvement in privacy, it’s important to note that FL is not a perfect solution. There are still risks, such as potential data leakage through model updates or attacks from malicious clients or servers. Therefore, privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy (DP), secure multi-party computation (MPC), or homomorphic encryption (HE) are often applied to FL.
In summary, FL differs from traditional machine learning by keeping data decentralized and limiting communication to model updates, thus enhancing privacy for AI applications. It provides a more privacy-conscious approach to training machine learning models that is essential in the modern world of user data privacy concerns.
