Unary operators don't exist in python (why?)


- one-liner code, if and else's can be one-liners
- `slicing` in python
- `_` can be used as a dummy variable in a loop (look more into this)
- Python programmers are commonly called Python developers or 
  Pythonistas.
- functional programming & procedural programming and OOPS
- byte code
- collections are iterable
- make a table of precedence for operators.
