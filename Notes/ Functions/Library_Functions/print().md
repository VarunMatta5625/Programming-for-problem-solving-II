# print() <br>
The print function in python can consist of the following <br>
`print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)`<br>
- Here, if observed properly, the `print()` statement, by default comes with a separation of a single whitespace. <br>
- It also executes and proceeds to the next line (by default) <br> 
---------
#### `+` Operator usage
Two strings can be concatenated by using `+` operator within the `print()` function.
<br> <br>
For example, <br>
```
print("Hello"+"World")
```
Outputs to,  
>HelloWorld 
---------
#### `,` operator usage
Two objects can be printed sequentially, by using `+` operator within the `print()` function.<br>
- This by default comes with a single white space (separator)
For example, <br>
```
print("Hello","World")
```
Outputs to,  
>Hello World
>
