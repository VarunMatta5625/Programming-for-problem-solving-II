# Bitwise Logical operators
`~` is called tilde, does a  1's compliment <br>
`|` is called vertical bar and can be used for <mark>bitwise or</mark>. <br>
`&` is called ampersand and is used for <mark>bitwise and</mark>. <br>
`^` is called caret and is used for <mark>exclusive or operation</mark>. <br>

----

<br>if we perform an `&` operator between a given number and 1 , and the result is given out as 0, 
<br> <br>
The number is clearly determined to be an even number. if the result is given as 1, then it is an odd number.
