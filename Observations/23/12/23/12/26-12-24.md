# Identity Operators

`is` & `is not` compares the addresses (memory locations) of two variables.

<br> Addresses are same for smaller size strings and numbers
and are NOT for larger sizes.
# Member Ship Operators
`in` and `not in` can be used to check if a sequence is in an object or not

Data inside a variable in stored as objects, and when two variables have same data (small data) ,they will be connected to the same object/
## Mutable and immutable 
Lists are mutable <br>
Strings and integers are  NOT mutable <br>
mostly everything else is not <br>

# Lookup
Collection and containers. - list, tuple, set, dict <br>
int , str, float
<br> `dir()` shows all the list of attributes and methods belonging to a specific object <br>
`help()` <br>
**Tuple()** <br>
**Hashable** can be tested via `hash()`, there is a connections between hashable and collection <br>
**ordered**

# Notes
Unary operators don't exist in python (why?) <br>
Python supports structural , Functional and oops paradigms <br>
