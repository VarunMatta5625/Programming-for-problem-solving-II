# Control Structures

## Control flow statements / Conditional Statements
### `if`
syntax:
```
if (condition):
    .......... code inside if case
```
**indentation is a must**


### `else`
syntax:
```
else (condition):
    .......... code for else 
```
**indentation is a must**


### `elif`
syntax: 
```
elif (condition):
    .......... code for else 
```
only applicable after at least one if case
**indentation is a must**

---

## Iteration statements / looping statements

### `for` loop
syntax :
```
for i in range({arguments}):
    ............ code for the loop
```
note : usage of membership operator `in`, and **indentation is obviously a must**

### `while` loop
syntax :
```
while({condition}):
    ............ code for the loop
```
**indentation is obviously a must**

# Built in functions 
1) `range()`
python range function requires atleast one argument and if an end limit argument is provided, it only considers till n-1.
syntax:
```
range( {start value}, {stop value}, {increment value for every iteration} )
```

a reverse sequence may be achieved by 
```
range( {stop value}, {start value}, {negative equivalent increment value for every iteration} )
```

example : 
`range(1,5,1)` : `1,2,3,4`
`range(5,1,-1)` : `5,4,3,2`

**stop value is devalued by 1**


`len()` 
returns the length of an object

# Notes
- one-liner code, if and else's can be one-liners
- `slicing` in python
- `_` can be used as a dummy variable in a loop (look more into this)
- Python programmers are commonly called Python developers or 
  Pythonistas.
- functional programming & procedural programming and OOPS
- byte code
