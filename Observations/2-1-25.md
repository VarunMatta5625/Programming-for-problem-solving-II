# Slicing 
Extension to indexing

indexing is used for fetching a single character.
But slicing can do more.

```
name = "Varun"
print(name[:])
```
outputs to `Varun`

the `:` can be used for slicing
and can be achieved the same using `slice()`

- values are `[ {start} : {stop} : {step} ]`
  indexing works w.r.t `-1`. 

- {start} is defaulted at `0`
- {stop} is needed to be specified till **one more** than required character.
- {step} can be negative or positive, depending on the increment requirements.


### defaultness of slicing 
{start} is default at **starting point**
{stop} is **end of collection**
{step} is default at `+1`


Slicing indexing works from 0 to 

Here's an example

```
name = "Varun"
print(name[0:2])
```
outputs to `Va`

## Negative Slicing

```
name = "Varun"
print(name[-5:-1])
```
